## Description 
When you first arrive at this webpage it will appear as if there isn't really an app at all. If you type in the name of a city it will show you the current date, time, temperature in degrees fahrenheit, humidity, and wind speed. It will also show you that infomation on the right side in a 5 day forecast. I built this application to practice working with API's. Check it out here https://magjoker.github.io/ALIVE-1997/
